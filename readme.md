# Dofus Temple

This is a project of a website which will unite all the tools that might be any useful to Dofus players. 
### Configuration
All the data is already there, what you need is a Docker program which will run the files and a php and laravel executables. For the time being everything is set just so the code would be visible, it is not currently intended for anyone else to be used. Minor changes might apply later on after the page launches.
