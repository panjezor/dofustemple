# Dofus Temple

This is a project of a website which will unite all the tools that might be any useful to Dofus players. 
### Configuration
All the data is already there, what you need is a Docker program which will run the files and a php and laravel executables. For the time being everything is set just so the code would be visible, it is not currently intended for anyone else to be used. Minor changes might apply later on after the page launches.
Otherwise, you can just copy-paste the whole www folder to your server and set up apache/nginx to get proper name.

### Upcoming features

- Daily quest reminders
- Manager for Ochre Dofus quest souls (multiple lists, shareable by different users)
- Proper dashboard for upcoming events
- Live chat
- Full localization of strings
- Collection of all useful links
- User forum
- Drop calculator for groups
- Make proper migration files for the tables (I guess I have to do this one)
- Customizable profiles
- Email verification

### Contribution

If you really would like to contribute, please message me, as currently I have some sort of idea on how I would like these done and what features they should cover.
