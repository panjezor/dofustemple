# Dofus Temple

This is a project of a website which will unite all the tools that might be any useful to Dofus players. 
### Configuration
For the time being everything is set just so the code would be visible, it is not currently intended for anyone else to be used. Minor changes might apply later on after the page launches.

### Upcoming features

- Daily quest reminders categorised by area, availability, time-consumption, level and rewards.
- Manager for Ochre Dofus quest souls (multiple lists, shareable by different users, split into different versions of the game and categorised by steps and type)
- Proper dashboard for upcoming events
- Live chat - used discord for now, might be going for pusher soon.
- Collection of all useful links
- User forum
- Drop calculator for groups improvement (putting data into db to recall - this requires monster db)
- Customizable profiles (next)
- Email verification
